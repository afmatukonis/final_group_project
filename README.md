.# final_group_project

Proposal Draft: 

We have a four people group.The project that we have decided on is to look at the possible correlation between the cost of college, inflation, and income. We will also look at cost of living in different areas as well as look at different economic classes and see if their rise in income and cost of living matches the others.
 
Our null hypothesis is that since income has not risen according to inflation, the cost of college should not have either, the cost of college should not be related to income.
 
Our alternative hypothesis is that since college financial aid is all income based it should have risen in accordance with income and therefore, they are independent of inflation.
 
 We will also look at the different tiers of universities/colleges and salaries guaranteed after graduation and how that relates to income and inflation. 

Graphs to create:
Look at different geographies and then compare the data of cost of living and salaries when compared to schools in that area
Map looking at cost of living when compared to income level (wealth) and cost of college across US
Looking at income vs. wealth and how that compares to the rise. 

Additionally we will talk about the unemployment rate and how that factors in and that the data is not reliable.
